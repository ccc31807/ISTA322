	<h1>My Meaningful Quotes</h1>
<h2>Oliver Cromwell</h2>
<h3>20 April 1653, London, England</h3>

<div style="text-transform: none; background-color: #ff0000;">It is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">high time</span> for me to put an end to your sitting in this place, which you have dishonored by your contempt of all virtue, and defiled by your practice of every vice.  Ye are a factious crew, and enemies to all good government.  Ye are a pack of mercenary wretches, and would like Esau sell your country for a mess of pottage, and like Judas betray your God for a few pieces of money.  Is there a single virtue now remaining amongst you? <span style="text-decoration: overline;">Is there one vice you do not possess?</span>  Ye have no more religion than my horse. Gold is your God. Which of you have not bartered your conscience for bribes? Is there a man amongst you that has the least care for the good of the Commonwealth?  Ye <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">sordid prostitutes</span> have you not defiled this sacred place, and turned the Lord's temple into a den of thieves, by your immoral principles and wicked practices?  Ye are grown intolerably odious to the whole nation. You were deputed here by the people to get grievances redressed, are yourselves become the greatest grievance.  Your country therefore calls upon me to cleanse this <span style="text-decoration: blink;">Augean stable</span>, by putting a final period to your iniquitous proceedings in this House; and which by God's help, and the strength he has given me, I am now come to do. </div> 
<br />
<p><span style="word-spacing: 1em;">I command ye therefore, upon the peril of your lives, to depart immediately out of this place.  Go, get you out! Make haste! Ye venal slaves be gone! So! Take away that shining bauble there, and lock up the doors.</span>  <br />
<span style="letter-spacing: 0.5em;">In the name of God, go!</span></p>

<h2>Thomas Jefferson</h2>
<h3>July 4, 1776, Philadelphia, Pa.</h3>

<div style="font-family: serif; font-style: normal; background-color: #00ff00;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">We hold these truths to be self-evident,</span> that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are <span style="font-size: 4pt;">Life</span>, <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Liberty</span> and the pursuit of <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Happiness</span>.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the <span style="font-size: 16pt;">Right</span> of the <span style="font-size: 20pt;">People</span> to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form,<span style="font-weight: 500;">as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.</span> </div>


<div style="font-family: serif; font-style: italic ; background-color: #0000ff;">Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their <span style="font-weight: 900;">duty</span>, to <span style="font-weight: 900;">throw off</span>such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.</div>

>Abraham Lincoln</h2>
<h3>November 19, 1863, Gettysburg, Pa.</h3>

<p style=" background-color: #ffff00;">Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.  Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.  But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.</p>

>Theodore Roosevelt</h2>
<h3>April 23, 1920, Paris, France</h3>
<div id="nodisplay">
This is an excellant quote well worthy of your attention.
</div>

<p style=" background-color: #ff00ff; color: #ffffff; font-size: 24pt; padding: 12px;">It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.</p>

>August 28, 1963, Washington, D.C.</h3>

<p style=" background-color: #00ffff;">And so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.  I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal." ...  I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.  I have a dream today!  I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight; "and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together." ...  With this faith, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith, we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith, we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.  And this will be the day -- this will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with new meaning: <p>

<div style="text-align: center; background-color: #aaaaaa;">My country 'tis of thee,<br />
 sweet land of liberty<br />
 of thee I sing.<br />
 Land where my fathers died,<br />
 land of the Pilgrim's pride,<br />
 From every mountainside,<br />
 let freedom ring!</div>
