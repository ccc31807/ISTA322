Panzerlied 

In rain storm or snow or in sun's laughing light, 
In day's scorching heat or in bitter cold night, 
Our faces covered with the dust 
But hearts with joy are filled (Yes, joy are filled), 
Our panzers like whirlwinds advance in the field. 

With thundering engine and lightening fast speed 
We charge toward the front on our steel sided steed, 
And leading on our comrades 
In the fight alone we stand (alone we stand), 
We break through the ranks of the foe's hostile band. 

When foes may appear with their tanks in our sight, 
We step on the throttle and race toward the fight. 
What value then has life for us? 
We serve the Reich's army (Yes, Reich's army), 
Our life's highest honor we give Germany. 

With trenches and mines the foe seeks to impede, 
We laugh in derision and pay him no heed, 
And when he trains his guns on us 
Emplaced in yellow sand (Yes, yellow sand) 
We find other ways that the foe had not planned. 

And when fickle luck will desert us at last 
Then comforts of home are but memories past, 
And when the fatal bullet strikes us 
Then no one can save (no one can save) 
Our panzer wil be our glorious grave.
